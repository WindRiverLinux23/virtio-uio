Building with the wr-virtio-uio layer
---------------------------------------

This layer should be added to the bblayers.conf file. This is done
automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

Always make sure that a Wind River Linux platform project is including
this layer for it to be used. E.g. --with-layer=<path to>/wr-virtio-uio

This layer comes with the following feature templates:

 * feature/virtio-uio:
   This feature adds the UIO kernel driver to the guest.

 * feature/virtio-userspace:
   This feature provides VirtIO userspace back-end driver.

Here are the basic instructions for using the wr-virtio-uio layer:

 1. Create a Wind River Linux build environment:

    ./wrlinux-x/setup.sh \
        --machines xilinx-zynqmp \
        --dl-layers --recipes pciutils --distro wrlinux \
        --layers meta-virtualization --layers meta-mingw \
        --template feature/docker,feature/posix_26,feature/xfce,feature/lxc

    . environment-setup-x86_64-wrlinuxsdk-linux

    . ./oe-init-build-env build-xilinx-zynqmp-initramfs

 2. Add the necessary layers.

 3. Add the wr-virtio-uio layer:

    bitbake-layers add-layer {installDir}/VirtIO/wr-virtio-uio

 4. Configure the build:

    Add the "virtio-uio virtio-userspace" to
    PACKAGE_INSTALL:append:pn-wrlinux-image-initramfs parameter in the
    conf/layers.conf. For example:
    'PACKAGE_INSTALL:append:pn-wrlinux-image-initramfs += "gdb gdbserver tcf-agent vnic virtio-uio virtio-userspace packagegroup-core-tools-debug memstat safeipc"

 5. Add virtio-userspace service: (not yet implemented)

    cp <installDir>/helix/guests/wrlinux-lts-23/classes_yyyymmdd/*.bbclass ../layers/local/classes

    echo "USER_CLASSES += \" virtio-userspace\"" >> conf/local.conf

 6. Build:

    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

    bitbake wrlinux-image-small

 7. Generate SDK (optional):

    a. Linux SDK

    bitbake -c populate_sdk wrlinux-image-small

    b. Windows SDK:

    SDKMACHINE=x86_64-mingw32 bitbake -c populate_sdk wrlinux-image-small
